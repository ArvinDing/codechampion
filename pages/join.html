If you are a high schooler who likes coding and is looking for an opportunity to give back to the community, you are at the right place! 
We are looking for tutors at all levels to teach elementary or middle school students. Training will be provided before you are matched to students at the levers you are confident of teaching.

What can be better than helping others while gaining valuable leadership skills at the same time? Community service hours will be granted as well.
